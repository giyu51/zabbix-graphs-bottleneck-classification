## :hammer_and_wrench: Usage

#### 1. üìä Zabbix Graphs Data Collection

To begin collecting data from Zabbix graphs periodically, follow these steps:

1. Configure the **[zabbix_conf.json](./zabbix_conf.json)** file:

    In the **[zabbix_conf.json](./zabbix_conf.json)** file, specify the following parameters:

    ```json
    {
        "COMPANY_DOMAIN_NAME": "example.com",
        "USERNAME": "your_username",
        "PASSWORD": "your_password",
        "IMAGE_DIRECTORY": "path_to_save_images",
        "REQUESTS_PER_HOUR": 4
    }
    ```

    Replace the values with your actual credentials and desired settings:
    |Parameter|Definition|
    |---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |üè¢ COMPANY_DOMAIN_NAME| Your Zabbix server domain name (e.g., monitoring.example.com or statistics.example.com).|
    |üë§ USERNAME | Your Zabbix account username.|
    |üîí PASSWORD | Your Zabbix account password.|
    |üñºÔ∏è IMAGE_DIRECTORY | The path to the directory where you want to save the downloaded images (e.g., `./images` or `images` or `images/`).|
    |üïí REQUESTS_PER_HOUR | The number of requests per hour to make to the Zabbix server (e.g., if equals to 4, the requests will be sent every 15 min (as 60 min/4)).|

---

2. Configure the **[graphs.csv](./graphs.csv)** file:

    In the **[graphs.csv](./graphs.csv)** file, specify the graphs you want to pull images from. Each line should follow the format:

    ```php
    <interface_name>,<item_id>
    # no spaces
    ```

    Here's an example of the **[graphs.csv](./graphs.csv)** file:

    ```csv
    Interface Number 1,263947
    Interface Number 2,2623413949
    Interface Number 3,2943124410
    Interface Number 4,265323961
    Interface Number 5,2953250400
    ```

    Replace the example entries with the actual interface names and corresponding item IDs from your Zabbix server.

---

3. Run **[get_data.py](./get_data.py)** to start data collection:
   <br>

    On the server where you want to collect the Zabbix graph images, execute the get_data.py script. This script will connect to the Zabbix server, download the graph images based on the specified interfaces and item IDs, and save them to the specified directory.

#### 2. üì∑Image Classification and Folder Structuring
By organizing the images into the specified folder structure, you will have separate directories for training and testing, with subfolders for bottleneck and non-bottleneck images. This structure will facilitate the subsequent steps of your project, such as model training and evaluation.

It involves classifying the collected images into specific folders. 

By default, the directory structure of [dataset](./dataset/) for the images is set as follows:

```shell
dataset
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ training
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bottleneck
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [bottleneck images]
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ not_bottleneck
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [non-bottleneck images]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testing
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bottleneck
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [bottleneck images]
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ not_bottleneck
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [non-bottleneck images]
```
> ### :warning: DO NOT change the any folder structure or folder names.


To classify the images into the appropriate folders:

- Move or copy the collected images into the appropriate folders based on their classification.
        
    - üìÅBottleneck images should be placed in the [bottleneck]() folders within the [training](./dataset/training/) and [testing](./dataset/testing/) directories.
        
    - üìÅNon-bottleneck images should be placed in the [not_bottleneck]() folders within the [training](./dataset/training/) and [testing](./dataset/testing/) directories.


:red_circle: Ensure that the images are correctly classified and placed in the respective folders according to their classification (bottleneck or non-bottleneck).

#### 3. :rocket:Model Training
To proceed with training the model, follow these steps:

1. üìùOpen the **[main.ipynb](./main.ipynb)** notebook.

2. ‚ñ∂Ô∏èRun all the cells in the notebook by selecting *"Run All"* from the *"Run"* menu or by clicking the appropriate button in your notebook interface.

3. ‚è≥If there are no errors during execution, the model training process will begin. As the training progresses, you will be able to monitor the logs and receive information about the overall process.

4. üíæOnce the training is completed, the trained model will be automatically saved to the **MK-1** folder. You can locate the saved model in this folder.

üìã Additionally, detailed logs about the training process, as well as information about the overall process, can be found in the **[logs/zabbix_logs.json](./logs/zabbix_logs.json)** file. Default log directory is **[./logs](./logs/)**, however it can be changed (read about it in [customization section](#art-customization))

By following these steps, you will be able to üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è run the training process, üíæ save the trained model, and üìä access relevant logs for reference.


## :art: Customization

In the **[main.ipynb](./main.ipynb)** file, you have the flexibility to customize various parameters to tailor the image classification and model training process according to your specific requirements. These parameters allow you to control aspects such as *directory paths*, *image settings*, *batch size*, *class names*, *training epochs*, and even the *model structure*.

By adjusting these customization parameters, you can adapt the project to different datasets, image dimensions, training preferences, and even experiment with different model architectures. 

```python

# Set the path to the main directory containing the training and testing folders
main_dir = './dataset'

# Define the subdirectories
train_dir = main_dir + '/training'
test_dir = main_dir + '/testing'
logs_dir = "./logs"

# Set the desired image settings
image_width = 1450
image_height = 291
image_size = (image_width, image_height)
resize_factor = 0.8  # Reduce photo size by 20%
batch_size = 1

# Specify the exact names of the two classes (two directories) located in both subdirectories
class_names = ['bottleneck', 'non_bottleneck']
epochs = 3


```

Feel free to modify these parameters based on your needs and preferences to achieve optimal results.:rocket: 

1. Directory Paths:
    + **main_dir**: Specifies the path to the main directory that contains the training and testing folders.
    + **train_dir**: Defines the subdirectory within the main directory for training data.
    + **test_dir**: Determines the subdirectory within the main directory for testing data.
    + **logs_dir**: Specifies the path to the log directory.

2. Image Settings:
    + **image_width**: Sets the desired width for the images in pixels.
    + **image_height**: Sets the desired height for the images in pixels.
    + **resize_factor**: Controls the percentage by which the photo size is reduced (e.g., 0.8 reduces the size by 20%).

3. Batch Size:
    + **batch_size**: Specifies the number of images to include in each training batch. Adjusting this parameter can impact the training speed and memory consumption.

4. Class Names:
    + **class_names**: Provides the exact names of the two classes (directories) present in both the training and testing subdirectories. Ensure that these names correspond correctly to your dataset.
5. Training Epochs:
    + **epochs**: Determines the number of training epochs, which represent the number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset.

6. Model Structure:

    **model**: Represents the model architecture used for image classification. You can customize the model structure by adding, removing, or modifying layers. The provided model structure includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, a flattening layer, and dense layers with specific activation functions.
## :page_with_curl: Code Description:

>Script **[get_data.py](./get_data.py)** : üìú

This code is used to collect images from a Zabbix monitoring system. It connects to the Zabbix API, authenticates the user, and downloads images corresponding to specified item IDs. The collected images are saved to a specified directory.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. The code starts by importing the necessary libraries and modules: requests, json, datetime, time, os, csv.
2. It reads the configuration file zabbix_conf.json to get the required parameters such as the company domain name, username, password, image directory, and requests per hour.
3. It checks if the specified image directory exists and creates it if it doesn't.
4. It sets the request configurations, including the URL and headers for making API requests.
5. It reads a CSV file named graphs.csv which contains interface names and their corresponding item IDs. It populates a dictionary (item_dict) with this data.
6. The current_time function returns the current timestamp in the desired format.
7. The authenticate_user function sends an API request to authenticate the user using the provided credentials. It retrieves and returns the session token required for subsequent requests.
8. The download_images function loops through the item IDs and constructs the image URL for each item. It sends a request to download the image, saves it to the specified image directory with a filename containing the timestamp and a file counter, and prints a success message.
9. The logout_user function sends a request to log out the user from the Zabbix system.
10. The main function is the entry point of the code. It runs in an infinite loop, authenticates the user, downloads images, logs out the user, and then waits for a specific interval defined by the requests per hour parameter.
11. Finally, the main function is called if the script is executed directly.

This code can be used as a standalone script to automate the collection of images from a Zabbix monitoring system at regular intervals. It can be further modified to add additional functionalities or integrated into a larger project.
